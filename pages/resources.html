        <div id="scratches-dents">
            <h2>Scratches and Dents</h2>
            <div>When conducting a car inspection, it's crucial not to assess the vehicle when it's wet, as it can
                conceal certain imperfections. Additionally, be sure to check for holes and dents, as these issues can
                have a significant impact on the car's value and should be considered during negotiations. Moreover,
                it's important to avoid underestimating the difficulty and cost of fixing scratches, especially when
                dealing with special paint colors that may not be readily available for new cars. Highlighting these
                factors can make strong points for negotiation when buying or selling a vehicle.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="windshield">
            <h2>Windshield (chips or cracks?)</h2>
            <div>During a thorough vehicle inspection, it is essential to check the condition of the glass surfaces,
                specifically for any chips or cracks. These imperfections not only compromise the aesthetics of the
                vehicle but also pose a safety risk.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="headlights">
            <h2>Headlights (foggy?)</h2>
            <div>Checking the condition of the headlights is a critical part of a vehicle inspection. One aspect to
                consider is whether the headlights appear foggy or hazy, which can be caused by oxidation and
                significantly affect their effectiveness and the overall aesthetics of the car. Restoring or replacing
                them can become a costly necessity, emphasizing the importance of this consideration during a vehicle
                assessment.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="inspection-sticker">
            <h2>Inspection Sticker Current?</h2>
            <div>
                Confirm the validity of the inspection sticker. Many regions implement a grace period, such as a
                six-month tolerance limit, allowing for flexibility beyond the stated expiration date.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="rusty-brake-rotors">
            <h2>Rusty Brake Rotors</h2>
            <div>
                Rusty brake rotors can serve as an indicator that a car may have been stationary for an extended period.
                This could signify potential issues or that the seller is eager to part with the vehicle, possibly at a
                reduced price. Evaluating the condition of the brake rotors can provide insights into the car's recent
                activity and potential negotiation leverage for the buyer.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="wheel-inspection">
            <h2>Wheel Inspection</h2>
            <div>Ensuring that the wheels are uniform, in good condition, and have sufficient tread depth is a
                foundational step in making a wise purchase. Begin by scrutinizing the wheels for uniformity. Ideally,
                all wheels should match in size, type, and style. Discrepancies in the wheels can result in uneven tire
                wear, impacting the car's handling and stability. Thoroughly assess the condition of the rims, keeping
                an eye out for any signs of damage or irregularities. Although curb rash and paint chips may seem
                cosmetic, they can influence the wheel's appearance and structural integrity over time. Equally
                essential is measuring the tread depth. A simple way to do this is by using a common coin to gauge the
                remaining tread life. If the tread does not reach the top of a coin's head, it's a strong indication
                that it's time to consider tire replacement. Additionally, many tires feature built-in tread wear
                indicators.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div id="transmission-type">

                <h2>Transmission Type</h2>
                <div>Determine whether the car has an automatic or manual transmission, depending on your driving
                    preferences and needs.</div>
            </div>
            <div id="seat-condition">
                <h2>Seat Condition</h2>
                <div>
                    Thoroughly inspect the condition of all seats. Look for tears, stains, or excessive wear. Check for any small cuts or unusual wear patterns.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="steering-wheel-condition">
                <h2>Steering Wheel Condition</h2>
                <div>
                    Check the steering wheel for signs of wear, ensure there are no peeling or
                    cracked surfaces.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="headliner-condition">
                <h2>Headliner Condition</h2>
                <div>
                    Inspect the headliner on the interior roof. Make sure it is not sagging or hanging, which could
                    indicate poor maintenance or water damage.
                    Apply the same level of scrutiny to the rear seats and the rear headliner, ensuring they are in good
                    condition.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="car-options">

                <h3>Car Options</h3>
                <div>Check for car options or features, such as navigation systems, sunroofs, and more. Ensure they are
                    functional and in good condition.</div>
            </div>
